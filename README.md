Introduction

In today’s technologically advanced world, we often hear the word “Artificial Intelligence”. Artificial
Intelligence is a simulation of human intelligence processed by a machine. With each day passing,
slowly we all are integrating artificial intelligence in our life. For example, Google Assistant and Siri.
We developed artificial intelligence because it can handle and do complex things which cannot be
done by Humans.
I felt a deep interest in artificial intelligence and understood its necessity in future. Therefore, I
thought of building my own Artificial Intelligence name Jarvis.
Overview
Jarvis is capable of understanding English and can give replies through its own intelligence. There
are no predefined replies given to Jarvis. I have automated all my frequents tasks through Jarvis.
Jarvis is also capable of handling many difficult mathematics questions. I have used advanced
machine learning ang data science in Jarvis.
Mainly, I have used Natural Language processing for understanding text and Computer Vision to
recognize gestures and people. I have used Python in Jarvis as it is highly recommended for Data
science.

Features

• Automated frequent tasks such as writing notes, sending mails, opening apps, etc.
• Gestures to make computer understand things easily without speaking.
• Own replies, no predefined replies.
• Solving complex mathematical problems.
• Face recognition for high security.
• Understanding user pattern of usage and developing itself to automate the tasks
